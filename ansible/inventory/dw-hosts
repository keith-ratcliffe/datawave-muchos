# The 'proxy' and 'hadoop' groups are re-declared here only as a workaround for a known
# issue with Ansible when merging multiple inventory files. No need to assign hosts. E.g.,
# without them, if this file happens to be parsed before the Muchos inventory file, then
# Ansible will throw an error and fail to create the 'datawave' group below.

# If ingesting Wikipedia data, your proxy host will download, extract, and write bz2
# streams to hdfs (See roles/wikipedia/README)

# Multiple hosts would actually be redundant in this context, so there's technically
# no need for the additional group declaration here

# If ingesting TVMAZE data, hosts assigned below will download and write the data to
# hdfs, so they are assumed to be capable of acting as hdfs clients.
#
# If your hosts don't have distinct public IP addresses, then you're probably better
# off just using a single host in this group (see roles/tvmaze/README)
